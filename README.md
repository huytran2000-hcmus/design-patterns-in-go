## Design pattern categories
- **Creational patterns**: These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and code reuse.
- **Structural patterns**: These patterns explains how to assemble objects and classes into bigger structures while keeping this structure flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns**: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and assignments of responsibilities between objects.

## Creational patterns
### Singleton patterns
#### Intent
**Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this pattern
#### Applicability
- Use when classes should have only one instance that get shared with all clients.
- Use when a resource is expensive to create and can be shared within the program.
